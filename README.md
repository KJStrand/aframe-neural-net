# Interpreting neural network architectures in VR

Ideas:
- Light animations to show convolutions, stride, move activation map grids 
- Convolution explanation animation
- Bill-boarded, small text descriptors
- color data
- t-SNE / meta-SNE transformations of data at each network layer: [visualizing representations](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-01-Visualizing-Representations/)

- [Stanford Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#conv)
- Explicitly show stride overlap during convolution, follow on with distill.pub article on checkerboard artifacts
- Show breakdown of memory, weights, parameters, compute time (maybe memory as color gradient filter for each block)
